When working with type systems like [TypeScript] or [Sorbet], type narrowing
patterns are a way to handle different types a variable may contain in different
branches. For example:

```ruby
sig do
  params(
    n: T.nilable(Integer)
  ).returns(
    T.nilable(Integer)
  )
end
def double(n)
  if n
    # n can't be nil in this branch, so sorbet
    # knows the type is narrowed to Integer.
    n * 2
  else
    # This branch could be implied, but is
    # here for clarity.
    nil
  end
end
```

Type narrowing applies to more than just [`T.nilable(X)`][nilable] to `X`. You
can use it to refine a type to a subset of some types allowed by a [union], or
from a value of some class to a value of a child class.

This works well on singular values, but when filtering an array sorbet asserts
that the resultant array has the same type. My guess is that this is to ensure
consistency between `select` and `select!` (the latter modifies in place).

```ruby
sig do
  params(
    array: T::Array[T.nilable(Integer)]
  ).returns(
    T::Array[Integer]
  )
end
def filter_and_double_array(array)
  # Sorbet thinks that integers is
  # T::Array[T.nilable(Integer)] :(
  integers = array.select { |n| n }

  # So it thinks the next line is broken,
  # although we know it's safe.
  integers.map { |n| n * 2 }
end
```

The brute force option here is to [`T.cast(x, Integer)`][cast] in the `map`, but
escape hatches like `T.cast` and [`T.must`][must] are a last resort. When the
type system is telling us the type we're safer.  There's also a runtime overhead
to using `T.cast` or `T.must`.

The solution is to use `filter_map`. It can be used to filter out the type(s)
you don't want (by returning `false` or `nil`), and _return_ those you do:

```ruby
sig do
  params(
    array: T::Array[T.nilable(Integer)]
  ).returns(
    T::Array[Integer]
  )
end
def filter_and_double_array(array)
  integers = array.filter_map { |n| n }
  integers.map { |n| n * 2 }
end
```

Or in this very simple case, the two array operations can be put together:

```ruby
sig do
  params(
    array: T::Array[T.nilable(Integer)]
  ).returns(
    T::Array[Integer]
  )
end
def filter_and_double(array)
  array.filter_map { |n| n * 2 if n }
end
```

Just like in the single value case, this works on more than just `T.nilable(X)`
to `X`. Filter an array of `Numeric` to an array of `Integer` (a child type of
`Numeric`):
```ruby
sig do
  params(
    array: T::Array[Numeric]
  ).returns(
    T::Array[Integer]
  )
end
def filter_non_integers(array)
  array.filter_map { |n| n if n.is_a?(Integer) }
end
```

Filter an array of some union or types to a subset of the union, in this case
`T.any(String, Integer, Boolean)` to `T.any(String, Integer)`:
```ruby
sig do
  params(
    array: T::Array[T.any(String, Integer, T::Boolean)]
  ).returns(
    T::Array[T.any(String, Integer)]
  )
end
def filter_non_integers(array)
  array.filter_map do |x|
    x if x != true && x != false
  end
end
```
