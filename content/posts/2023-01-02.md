This time last year I put together some custom scripts to send a record of each
study session to my personal site using the [micropub] endpoint. You can see
them [here][study-sessions]. Each entry says what I did, how long I did it for,
and when I started doing it. On their own these aren't particularly interesting
or useful. They mostly serve to hold me accountable. However, now that I have a
full year of data, it seems like a good time to see if there are any trends!

I also took lessons during 2022, but I'm not including those here. Study
sessions as I define them here are solo study time, but that does include
homework. While I have categorized each session, the vast majority of time was
spent on [WaniKani] and [Bunpro], both of which I categorize as flashcards.

- The _most_ time I spent studying on a single day was 88 minutes.
- The _least_ time I spent studying on a single day was (unsurprisingly) 0 minutes.
- I averaged about 17 minutes a day.
- The _most_ time I spent studying in a calendar week was 5 hours and 47 minutes.
- The _least_ time I spent studying in a calendar week was (regrettably, but we'll get to that) 0 hours.
- I studied the least on Saturdays (averaging about 11 minutes), and the most on Sundays (averaging about 24 minutes).

There were days and weeks in which I apparently did no study at all. Missing
days may not be surprising (family, holidays, illness, etc.), but whole weeks
surely are. The study minutes for each calendar week plot below helps to explain
what happened.

Week 1 aside (January 1st 2022 was a Saturday) you can see that I started out
with _good intentions_[^][We know where the road those pave goes.]. At the time
I didn't have much structure to my study, and the tools I used were not working
well for me. I was using flash card applications like [Memrise] and [Busuu]
which are general purpose. Japanese (and probably many or most other languages)
is a unique beast, and these general purpose flash card apps didn't do a great
job in my case.

At the end of May I resolved to [build a study habit]. That's where you can see
my study minutes really take off. A mixture of finding interesting reading
material within my comprehension and a couple of learning applications (I
mentioned [WaniKani] and [Bunpro] above) helped a lot. These applications are
designed specifically for Japanese, and I'm getting much better results from
them. I also changed my morning routine to include waking up a little earlier,
heading to a local coffee shop, and clearing my review backlog for both each
weekday morning before work.

I appear to have peaked in the Autumn. At the time I was doing a lot of reading
and I think I need to push in that direction a bit more rather than leaning on
flashcards alone. I have plenty to read to keep me going for a while!

My resolution for this year is to regain all the ground I've lost since I passed
the [JLPT] N4 exam a decade ago, and sit the N3 exam in December. I'm going to
need to increase my study minutes (I'm still considering where to place this
but a minimum of 30 minutes a day seems like a good goal) and sign up for more
lessons.
