A generative patchwork of pastel colours. The colours begin with a randomly
picked colour in [LCH](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#lab-colors). Other
colours are hue rotations in LCH space so that they're perceptually nice
together. Feature detection is used to render using LCH colours when the browser
supports them (Safari only at the time of writing), or to pick a close colour in
RGB space when LCH is not supported (the code for this is based on code in
[d3-color](https://github.com/d3/d3-color)). Refreshing generates a new
patchwork.
