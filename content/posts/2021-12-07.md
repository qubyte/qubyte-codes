Below is a procedural snowflake. I'm using a little code to create Christmas
cards this year, and I wanted each to be unique! If you received a card from me,
you may see something like `?seed=1234567890` in the URL bar. That will be the
random seed which generated your snowflake (and it's yours to keep). To see a
random snowflake, remove everything after the question mark and hit enter.
Refresh the page to see a fresh random snowflake!

The red colour is a convenience to make it show up in the software I use to
cut card.
