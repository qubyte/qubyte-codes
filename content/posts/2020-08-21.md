This experiment was inspired by field of [_twistronics_][twistronics], the study
of the intersesting properties of misaligned graphene sheets. The misalignment
produces a [moir√© pattern][moire] which echoes the underlying structure. I'm too
lazy to do hexagonal grids in an afternoon of tinkering so I used triangular
grids instead.
