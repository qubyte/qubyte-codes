This site uses a static site generator to build plain HTML pages. Since there's
no database to add, update, or delete pages from, determining when to dispatch
mentions can be challenging! Here's how I use a Netlify
[build plugin][build-plugins] and an [atom feed] to manage it.

The [Webmention spec][webmentions] requires that a mention should be sent
whenever a link is added or removed from a page, or the page one is on is
updated or deleted. The recipient will receive an HTTP post which looks the same
whatever happened. It's up to them to determine what changed.

Netlify provides hooks for various stages of the build, and a plugin may use as
many as it needs. I use the `onPostBuild` and `onSuccess` hooks. The former is
called when the build is complete, but _before_ it is deployed. This gives me
access to the old atom feed and pages over the network (the old version of the
site is still deployed), and new versions in the build directory. Mentions are
gathered and kept until the `onSuccess` hook. This hook fires when the site is
deployed. It's important to wait for the deployment because the receiver of a
mention may automatically check the content of the source URL to know what
happened.

If you prefer to read code, [check it out here][webmention-plugin].

This is just the beginning! I plan to port other capabilities over to Netlify
build plugins in time.
