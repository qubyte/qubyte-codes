Last weekend we held [IndieWebCamp Brighton 2024], the first in Brighton since
2019. I thought I'd collect my thoughts both as a host, and as an attendee.

The first signs something like this might happen (only from my perspective) were
back in November, when I tried to gather people for an impromptu
[Homebrew Website Club] while people were in town for [ffconf 2023]. I had
[commented to Ana] on Mastodon that I was missing the Homebrew Website Club that
used to run here in Brighton, and she suggested something close to such an
event. That met with limited success because of the short notice, but [Paul]
came, and I think we both realized that there may be enough interest. I didn't
know it at the time, but Paul had attended [IndieWebCamp Nuremberg 2023] just
a few weeks before (which is where the seeds for Brighton 2024 were _actually_
planted).

So we (mostly Paul) got on with organizing things. I'm a member of [The Skiff],
which we chose for the venue, so I took charge of that bit. On the weekend it
meant being first there to open up and last out to lock up. I also took on the
pastries for the first day[^][The pastries almost didn't happen. I had
originally ordered them for the afternoon before because the earliest the form
would allow was 11am (what kind of monster eats a croissant after 11am?). I
didn't want to give people stale pastries though, so I contacted them and they
said the option wasn't there because they were short staffed, but since I wanted
to pick them up from a shop they could deliver them there with the shop pastry
order for 8am, no problem. Of course, this didn't happen. When the (very patient
and helpful) person in the store contacted the bakery, the bakery said that they
couldn't do 8am after all. They wanted to tell me, but they were too short
staffed to do that. The lady in the shop negotiated with them, and she gave me
pastries from their own stock and there were enough left that when my order
arrived at 11 it would be used to replenish it.], and good local coffee, teas,
and milk and milk alternatives. On the weekend I also did my best to make folk
feel at home and to tell people about the place and a little local
history[^][More than one poor soul now knows more than they needed to about the
[Woodingdean Well]].

## Saturday: Introductions, planning, and discussions

After refreshments and some introductions, we started the planning session.
IndieWebCamps follow the [BarCamp] model of collectively planning session.
[Jeremy] officiated the process, and once we'd found a good [schedule] of
discussions, spaces, and times.

There was a session I wanted to participate in for each time slot.

### [Energy Efficiency](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/energy-efficiency)

I wanted to be a part of this one because I've put so much effort into getting
the footprint of my own site as low as possible. We discussed efficiency
server-side, client-side, in transmission, and the costs and benefits of single
servers vs large data centres.

We explored static sites versus dynamically served sites. Static sites are a
good way to serve efficiently, but harder to integrate IndieWeb standards like
[Webmentions] into.

We also discussed how our efforts were a drop in the ocean compared with the
vast energy overheads of the elephants like Facebook. I argued that my time with
the IndieWeb helped me to advocate for more efficient means of creating and
deploying sites in the companies I work for.

### [Pictures](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/pictures)

This site uses a static site build, and the content is committed to a git
repository. At the moment, so are the images. This bothers me because git works
best with text files, and images will slow down clones over time. I've been
wondering about storing images separately. Fortunately for me, others share this
pain point, and that's what we talked about in this session.

Various bucket-like solutions were discussed, and [Paul Watson] shared that a
combination of S3 and CloudFront cost him on the order of cents per month for a
site which is image heavy (making it, and similar combinations through other
vendors a good solution).

### [Hosting](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/hosting)

This was a discussion about the different kinds of hosting. For example, static
sites hosted on GitHub, Netlify, Vercel, etc. on one end of the spectrum,
virtual private servers (or even real personal servers) on the other end, and
middle ground solutions like DreamHost which help to administer server
applications in the middle.

We discussed the pros and cons of them all, including avoiding hosting traps
which make it hard to move your site. There's a clear need for a decision tree
to help folk starting out to make a good choice without overwhelming them with
lots of information. There's lots more in the linked discussion.

### [NFC](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/nfc)

This was a fun session. [Terence] bought some NFC tags for us to encode and play
with. I configured mine to trigger my study-session shortcut (which sends an
h-event to my site with the category and duration of a session) when I wave my
phone over it. I successfully did not accidentally try to hijack the session by
talking about an ingenious spying device called [The Thing], which is an
ancestor technology.

### [Personal website pain points](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton/pains)

The final session of the day was a sort of support group, where we could talk
about the various problems with our sites as they are now that prevent us from
posting to them more, or which just bother us.

A theme which emerged over Saturday was _URL regret_. Earlier decisions about
the structure of a site determine URLs of pages in a way which no longer seems
correct. For example, this URL for this page is under `/blog/`, but I don't
really think of many posts I've written on this site as blog entries. In fact,
internally they've always been managed as _posts_. URLs link the web together,
so we don't want to break them! The options are:

- Keep pages where they are.
- Move pages and add permanent redirects to them so old links continue to work.
- Move the pages, and accept that links will break. Perhaps give just the most
  important pages redirects.

[Digital gardening] was another theme of the day. A traditional blog lends
itself to the idea of a _feed_. A linear collection of entries, usually in
chronological order of publication. Chronology is much less important in a
digital garden, since the intent is to update posts over time[^][This is not an
excuse not to show publication and update time stamps!]. The move from linear
feeds to gardening was the root of some URL regret in this session.

## [Sunday: Hacking, writing, and demos][demos]

After a day of discussion it feels fantastic to build something! The day was
split into about three hours in the morning and three hours after lunch for
hacking and writing, and demos after.

In the morning, [Scout] and I paired to buy a domain name, and wire DNS up to
[GitHub Pages]. Scout is an organizer at the [CodeBar Brighton] chapter, so
she's no stranger to GitHub (making pages an ideal starting place)! Of course,
being DNS, it took us a while to figure out its interaction with GitHub's funky
way of doing things, but we got there. This was the highlight of the weekend for
me. Another independent, personal site on the web!

I used the afternoon to scratch some itches. I recently wrote a [colophon], but
it needed some editing and nothing linked to it, so I gave it a bit of polish
and added a link to it from [my about page](/).

Next I worked on CSS. The main CSS file (the one used by every page here) was at
risk of becoming a bit of a dumping ground. Most pages don't use syntax
highlighting or MathML styles, so I put those in their own files. Both are third
party anyway, so it makes sense to keep them separate and versioned with their
associated dependencies. This was mostly plumbing work to configure my static
site generator.

Finally, I tweaked a little of the code I use for [ruby annotations]. Each page
with Japanese text on it has a little select dropdown which can be used to
position the annotation above or below the main text, or hide it entirely.
[Thanks to the `:has()` CSS pseudo-class][has-ruby] no JavaScript is needed to
do this. _Remembering_ the preference, however, does need JS. So these pages
have a tiny JS script which stores the setting in `localStorage`. I tweaked the
script so that when the user sets it to "above" (the default), the script
deletes the setting, rather than storing "above".

To wrap up the day [we demoed what we'd written and made][demos]. Click through
to explore those (there's too much good stuff to do it justice here).

## Wrapping up

The other attendees kindly helped me to restore The Skiff to its original layout
and clean up. Once we were done, I locked up, and a few of us went for a well
deserved drink.
