The day was packed with interesting and diverse talks, and there's just too much
to talk about in a single post. It's definitely worth searching around for other
blog posts to see other's takes on the day!

The talk which I find myself thinking about the most was
[Charlotte Dann's][charlotte-dann]. The journey from exploration in generative
art to producing [custom real-world jewelery][hexatope] was inspiring! It seems
to have inspired others too, since it precipitated the creation of
[a creative coding meetup][generator-btn] here in brighton, which I hope to find
some time to get involved with.

In the spirit of that talk, here's a quick Conway's Game of Life demo (requires
JavaScript to be enabled). It loops around (so the world looks square but it's
really a torus). It's pretty basic! In the spirit of the talk, I hope to apply
similar rules to different tilings. Refresh to restart.
