Just before Christmas I gave a presentation on the upcoming async-await JavaScript language feature,
its basis in promises and generators, and finally a tiny server framework (like Express but a lot
leaner and more modular) which can make use of async functions as middleware (since an async
function is indistinguishable from a normal function which returns a promise). I'll introduce Toisu!
in a blog post soon, but until then here's the presentation:
