I had some issues getting the [v3 AWS SDK for JavaScript][v3] to communicate
with localstack S3, but I found a solution! With the [V2 JS SDK][v2], the
configuration object for the S3 client looks like:

```json
{
  "region": "eu-west-1",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:4566",
  "s3ForcePathStyle": true
}
```

The last field tells the sdk not to use `<bucket>.hostname` style connections,
and instead puts the bucket in the path. For local dev this is important because
otherwise the SDK tries to make connections to `<bucket>.localhost`. This'll
work when managing buckets, but not when dealing with their contents (unless you
add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file, which often isn't practical).

Unfortunately this field doesn't exist for v3, and after searching I didn't find
all that much except for a couple of mentions of the v3 JS SDK no longer
supporting it.

Fortunately it's not actually the case. It was just renamed to `forcePathStyle`!

```javascript
const { S3Client } = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');

const s3 = new S3Client({
  region: 'eu-west-1', // The value here doesn't matter.
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:4566', // This is the localstack EDGE_PORT
  forcePathStyle: true
});
```

For reference, I boot localstack with this [docker-compose][compose]
configuration:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  mock-s3:
    image: localstack/localstack:latest
    ports:
      - "4566-4583:4566-4583"
    environment:
      - AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-1
      - EDGE_PORT=4566
      - SERVICES=s3
      - DEBUG=1
      - DATA_DIR=/tmp/localstack/data
    volumes:
      - "./.localstack:/tmp/localstack"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
```
