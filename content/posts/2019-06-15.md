In the past [I used atd](/blog/how-i-schedule-posts-using-atd) to schedule the
publication of my blog posts. When I moved to Netlify I lost the ability to
schedule posts, and didn't think about it until
[a recent conversation on twitter][convo] with [Remy Sharp][remy]. Remy asked
how to schedule blog posts for static sites and it got me thinking.

I've been using GitHub actions recently, and one workflow trigger it provides
is a [cron-like schedule][cron-like]. I wrote a little npm script to read a
directory full of scheduled posts. Each post has its publication date checked,
and if it's in the past, the script moves the post to the published posts
directory (at which point Netlify kicks in). The script takes advantage of the
token provided by the [actions environment][environment] to make two requests,
one to recreate the file in the posts directory, and one to delete the scheduled
file using the GitHub [Contents API][contents-api].

Sadly, there's no way to _move_ a file using the Contents API, so the
create-then-delete is necessary. This leads to two commits rather than just
one. It may be possible to do it in a single commit using the
[Trees API][trees-api], but that's a good deal more involved and I don't mind
a little noise in the commit history.

You can see the workflow using this script [here][workflow], and the publisher
[here][publisher].

Of course, the scheduler published this post. ;)
