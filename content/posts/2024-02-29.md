In 2001 I found myself falling down a mechanical keyboard rabbit hole. It
started off with two ortholinear (keys laid out in a grid) keyboards requiring
minimal assembly (mostly adding my own switches and key caps). From there I
moved onto a split keyboard (one unit per hand, connected together by a cable)
with a column staggered layout (keys are aligned in columns, rather than rows
like a conventional keyboard). In the end it was inevitable that I would try to
design my own, but what did I want?

## The wish list

Constraints breed creativity, so I decided to be restrictive:

- It should be a split keyboard, like a [Corne] or a [Ferris]. Allowing
  the hands to be further apart helps to avoid some fatigue, and means the
  position of each hand can be adjusted. It also enforces which hand owns which
  keys (no wandering to the wrong side of the keyboard).
- It should use only one controller, and no IO extenders. Most split keyboards
  use one of these approaches, but it seems wasteful to me just to save on a few
  wires bridging the two halves of the keyboard. Usually a TTRS cable is used
  (a headphone cable). The number of wires depends on a few things, but the
  lower bound using a matrix (there are other approaches which can use fewer
  wires) is twice the square root of the number of keys, rounded up.
- It should be a 36 key build, with [Miryoku] bindings. The idea here is to
  minimize how far each digit needs to move, again to reduce fatigue.
- It should be built for my hands. I have long fingers and a particular way of
  positioning my hands which feels comfortable for me. I've noticed that most
  split keyboards tuck the thumb keys as a short row or arc below the finger
  columns. My thumbs want to splay out more than that.

## PCB (printed circuit board) design

While it's possible (and fairly common) to hand-wire keyboards, the constraints
above led to a rough idea of what I wanted, which included some visible PCB. PCB
design is new to me, so I had to figure out how to do that. Thankfully there are
guides (I used [this one][pcb-design]). Since I was going with a controller, I
didn't need to worry about much of this guide. The important bit for me was how
to do a key matrix. The software I used is KiCad, which is free, and libraries
can be installed using plain old git submodules (ordinarily I'd balk at
submodules, but this is a rare use case where they make sense). I ignored the
guide and borrowed the libraries used by other custom keyboard kits since many
of them are in GitHub.

PCB design in KiCad is split into different parts. First you have to lay out a
schematic, and then you use than to send parts to a PCB for layout and to join
parts together with tracks. The nice thing about doing it this way is that the
schematic is abstract. You can wire things together without considering layout,
and in the PCB design view you arrange parts (particularly switches for a
keyboard) and you're given guides to show which parts still need to be
connected. Here's what my schematic looked like:

<img src="/images/fg-11-rev1-schematic.png" width="800" height="508" lazy>

At the top centre is a pro-micro, with all its pins labelled. This is straight
out of a component library. The two grids on the left and right are the key
switch matrix. While there is a group of switches per hand, the matrix is joined
through the IDC connectors in the middle. Labels are used to show how things are
connected without traces cluttering up the diagram. For things like switches you
can choose and change footprints, so if you want to replace MX switches with
choc switches (which is something I did half-way through), the schematic doesn't
change, just the footprints used on the PCB.

TODO: PCB design and layout.

The result is the FG-11 Rev1:

## Retrospective

After a few months using the device I've had time to understand what worked well
and what did not.

Firstly, [Miryoku] wasn't for me. I like the idea, but it's just too much of a
jump from conventional typing for me. I ended up creating a custom layered
layout, which covers all the keys I actually use (no mouse keys).

Next, the column stagger is good, but the wrong columns are staggered. If you
think of the little notches or nubbins on the `f` and `j` keys, most people
(myself included) seek these with their index fingers. The column stagger I
designed for the FG-11 Rev1 effectively wanted makes me place my middle fingers
on these keys, so it's like learning to type again because everything is shifted
one column over.

On the stagger, this had the intended effect of having my hands in a sort of
cupped position, with the wrists at 45 degrees to the ground (halfway between
flat against the desk and vertical). This is a comfortable typing position for
me.

The ribbon to connect the two sides is very flexible. I had no trouble
positioning each half wherever I wanted with it.

One weird thing that occasionally happens is that a modifier key (typically
shift) will stop working. I think this is a software issue since other keys in
the row and column of the affected key are fine, and unplugging the keyboard for
a bit seems to fix the issue. I may try updating QMK and re-flashing the
controller to see if it helps.

On the build, the laser cut steel plates have a very pleasing look and feel. The
give a lot of weight to the keyboard too, which I really like. I've found that
split keyboards often feel too light.

## The future

The keyboard is good, but flawed. The next revision will have these changes:

- Column stagger moved outwards one column on each side.
- Per-key backlighting. From the schematics of similar split keyboards I'm
  pretty sure the controller can support enough LEDs to cover 36 keys.
- Brass plates. I like the steel plates, but I think brass plates will work well
  with the Work Louder choc key caps.
- I'm considering a different connector standard to join the two halves. Maybe
  something silly like a pair of PS/2 connectors per side, or a D-Sub 15
  connector per side. I may keep the ribbon for flexibility though. It'd be nice
  to source something which isn't a bland grey.
- If I can make the power budget stretch, I may add a couple of extra pinky keys
  per side. The 5x4 matrix can support this with no need for additional wires
  between the two halves. I'd definitely like to have escape and tab keys on the
  left, and enter and backspace on the right would be nice too. Except for
  backspace the FG-11 Rev1 uses chording to achieve these, and it's a bit of a
  faff.
