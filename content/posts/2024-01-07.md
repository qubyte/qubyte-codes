I've been tracking my Japanese language study session since 2022. You can see
the [first year report](/blog/my-2022-japanese-language-study-habits) for
comparison.

This year my regular Japanese tutor has been taking maternity leave, so I've
been doing conversation lessons with another tutor. The format is a little
different, and I think this change helped to spark some improvements in my
development. Before a typical lesson I'm given an article to read in Japanese.
I then spend part of the lesson chatting with my tutor, and the rest re-reading
the article, answering comprehension questions, and discussing it. These lessons
aren't included in the data, but I do include the pre-lesson read of an article
as reading time. As for last time year, while I have categorized each session,
the vast majority of time was spent on [WaniKani] and [Bunpro], both of which I
categorize as flashcards.

- The _most_ time I spent studying on a single day was 80 minutes.
- The _least_ time I spent studying on a single day was (unsurprisingly) 0
  minutes.
- I averaged about 16 minutes a day.
- The _most_ time I spent studying in a calendar week was 2 hours and 56
  minutes.
- The _least_ time I spent studying in a calendar week was (regrettably) 0
  hours.
- I studied the least on Fridays (averaging about 10 minutes), and the most on
  Sundays (averaging about 25 minutes).

There were days and weeks in which I apparently did no study at all. Missing
days may not be surprising (family, holidays, illness, etc.), but whole weeks
surely are. The study minutes for each calendar week plot below helps to explain
what happened.

The gap you see was when I was in Japan! I think I can give myself a pass for
that.

One vague trend I see is a decline in minutes studied over the year. I also
studied slightly less over this year than last year. Within the two flashcard
apps I lean most heavily on, my progress has slowed a lot too. Partly I think
this is because I've built up a collection of cards I find difficult to
memorize, and that's both hurting my motivation and constricting the flow of new
cards. I'll make a more focussed effort to memorize these difficult cards, even
if it means I have to write them out by hand a lot or something.

Another thing I've noticed is that with the grammar focussed app ([Bunpro]) is
that it's way more than just a flashcard app, and I'm underutilizing it. This is
not just to get the most value out of it; I've found that simple repetition
isn't enough to learn many grammar points (what I think of as natural
acquisition, like a child might learn). I'm going to have to sit down and start
writing proper notes out. Of course, I have the [notes section](/japanese-notes)
of this site, but nothing beats doing it by hand with glittery gel pens.

My resolutions [from last year](/blog/my-2022-japanese-language-study-habits):

> ...regain all the ground I've lost since I passed
> the [JLPT] N4 exam a decade ago, and sit the N3 exam in December. I'm going to
> need to increase my study minutes (I'm still considering where to place this
> but a minimum of 30 minutes a day seems like a good goal) and sign up for more
> lessons.

I'm _almost_ back to where I was when I passed the N4, and in terms of listening
and speaking I'm more advanced thanks to signing up for more tuition. As for
sitting the N3... not even close. That's a good goal to have, but in hindsight
it was a high target given the free time I have around work and family.

This year? More of the same! Regain the remaining lost ground with respect to
N4, improve my conversation skills, and work toward sitting the N3. I don't know
if I'll do that this year (I'd say probably not given my trajectory). Goals
should be measurable though, so here's what I'm promising myself:

- Properly write out 5 grammar points a week, guided by Bunpro.
- Revise one grammar point per day.
- Read one article on [NHK News Web Easy](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/) a
  day.
- Continue with flashcards. At least fifteen minutes per day.

Those don't represent a lot of time, but they _do_ need organization and
discipline, which I'm not so great at. Wish me luck!
