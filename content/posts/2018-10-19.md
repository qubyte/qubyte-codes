Nested resources are common in real life, and when you're a programmer working
on RESTful APIs you may have noticed that there are often trade-offs when it
comes to formatting the routes of nested resources.

Let's say we're building an API for carpenters. Their guild wants a way to help
the carpenters manage their clients, and the items which they're creating for
their clients (jobs). A set of routes for this might look like

```properties
GET  /carpenters
POST /carpenters
GET  /carpenters/:carpenterId

GET  /clients
POST /clients
GET  /clients/:clientId

GET  /jobs
POST /jobs
GET  /jobs/:jobId
```

where segments preceded by a colon are placeholders for a UUID. The first route
of each group gets a collection, the second creates a new member, and the third
gets a member by its ID. There may well be other operations like the third which
act on individual members of a collection, such as PUT for replacing and DELETE
for removal.

The problem with this layout is that, as a carpenter, you're rarely going to
want to see clients which aren't _your_ clients. There may also be lots of jobs,
and making a request for a list of jobs could select a huge number of them.
Usually you'll want to filter it by the client. We can use query parameters to
supply additional context, but this seems a bit clumsy. Let's have another go

```properties
GET  /carpenters
POST /carpenters
GET  /carpenters/:carpenterId

GET  /carpenters/:carpenterId/clients
POST /carpenters/:carpenterId/clients
GET  /carpenters/:carpenterId/clients/:clientId

GET  /carpenters/:carpenterId/clients/:clientId/jobs
POST /carpenters/:carpenterId/clients/:clientId/jobs
GET  /carpenters/:carpenterId/clients/:clientId/jobs/:jobId
```

It's pretty clear now that these are nested resources. It's no longer possible
to select a collection without refining it by its parent resources.

The problem now is that it's a bit annoying to have to use _all_ the parent IDs
of a list or a member. I recently realised (and I'm probably late to the party)
that a good solution is a compromise between the two

```properties
GET  /carpenters
POST /carpenters
GET  /carpenters/:carpenterId

GET  /carpenters/:carpenterId/clients
POST /carpenters/:carpenterId/clients
GET  /clients/:clientId

GET  /clients/:clientId/jobs
POST /clients/:clientId/jobs
GET  /jobs/:jobId
```

In this arrangement, we need to use a route with a parent ID when listing a
resource or creating a new member. When we already have an ID of a resource we
don't need to include its parent in the path. This includes other singular
operations such as PUT and DELETE.

Finally, a word on nesting. The implicit assertion made above is that a child
resource has a single parent, which may not be the case. Think of the solution
above as a filtering mechanism. i.e. a client may have contracted more than one
carpenter. You may also want to list jobs for a carpenter, rather than for a
client. If you find yourself writing too many routes, using query parameters may
be the lesser evil. Be pragmatic!
