Here are a selection of albums which are all-time favourites of mine. They stand
up as a whole (not just as single tracks). I don’t claim to have good taste in
music, or that my taste is better than anyone else’s! With each album I’ve
written a little about times and places I associate with it. The albums are
presented in no particular order. I’ll garden this post over time and add new
material. I've linked to music services where I can find each album available,
but with minimal effort. There are other services, but they're either behind
paywalls or incomprehensible to me.

## Devin Townsend – Terria

![The album cover for Terria](/images/fair-use/terria.jpeg)

- [Bandcamp](https://devintownsendofficial.bandcamp.com/album/terria)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6w2kw48F3xyHLgY4GDwFRV)
- [Apple](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/terria/1045112739)

This was the first music from Devin Townsend which I was exposed to. It was in
2002 I think, and I was listening more or less exclusively to bad metal at the
time. The weight of the sound of this album was what lured me in (particularly
Earth Day), but the progressive rock feeling to it led to a diversification of
my taste. This album evokes a feeling of vast landscapes and greenery. It, and
Ocean Machine remind me of my undergraduate years at Sussex University.

To this day I’m a big fan of Townsend. No two offerings are the same, and some
of his stuff is really out there.

## Strapping Young Lad – City

- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/78Y2OaDAdvEqs3TRdCRdZc)
- [Apple](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/city/1045623722)

I sneaked in another Devin Townsend album. Until about the mid 2000s Devin
Townsend also headed the metal band Strapping Young Lad (SYL). I’m less fond of
the output of SYL these days, but I still come back to City. It’s probably the
finest industrial metal album out there. This album also reminds me of my time
at Sussex University. That, and my questionable taste in clothing at the time
(very baggy, not a lot of colour, tassels).

## Portishead – Dummy

![The album cover for Dummy](/images/fair-use/dummy.jpeg)

- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3539EbNgIdEDGBKkUf4wno)
- [Apple](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/dummy/1440653096)

While at university I had a complicated relationship with a woman who introduced
me to Portishead. Things between us ended poorly, and this album reminds me of a
time when my head was in bad shape. I can listen to it now with more
objectivity, even if it makes me uncomfortable. The music should require no
introduction. The hauntingly beautiful vocals of Beth Gibbons and trip-hop
sound are timeless.

## ISIS (the band) – Panopticon

![The album cover for Panopticon](/images/fair-use/panopticon.jpeg)

- [Bandcamp](https://isistheband.bandcamp.com/album/panopticon-remastered)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4YVSY6TwnXWH7Jz4olWO1e)
- [Apple](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/panopticon-remastered/1001664659)

While a postgrad at Leeds University my like of metal and progressive rock
mutated into a like of post-rock. ISIS (long before the terrorist group
sometimes affiliated with that initialism came to be) was a heavy post-rock
/metal group which produced some extraordinarily heavy music. Panopticon is my
favourite of their albums, to the point that I named my first open source
offering after it.

## Opeth – Blackwater Park

![The album cover for Blackwater Park](/images/fair-use/blackwater-park.jpeg)

- [Omerch (buy)](https://opeth.omerch.com/products/opeth-blackwater-park-cd)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3CCkWrqhWcKU7qXK3ooEEo)
- [Apple](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/blackwater-park/363715800)

While the first Opeth album I got into was Still Life (and Deliverance &
Damnation come close), my favourite remains Blackwater Park. Most of the music I
listen to avoids guitar solos and such. Opeth manage to do the reverse, and have
moments when every instrument seems to be executing a solo at the same time and
maintain coherence. I was originally hooked by The Drapery Falls, but the entire
album is exquisite. Give it a try, even if the thought of death-growl vocals is
off putting to you. It’s worth it.

## Múm – Finally We Are No One

![The album cover for Finally We Are No One](/images/fair-use/finally-we-are-no-one.jpeg)

- [Bandcamp](https://fatcatrecords.bandcamp.com/album/finally-we-are-no-one)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2XCcnYJJQXYoWm5oc20x9k)
- [Apple](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/finally-we-are-no-one/285318218)

I was introduced to this me by an Italian I met in Tokyo (she introduced me to a
lot of really great music, I should thank her again). This album should sound
light and airy, but comes across and close and comforting, like being indoors by
a fire during a coastal storm. While I first listened to it in Tokyo I don’t
associate it with there. Its aesthetic is so strong that it tries to invoke
memories of a particular balance that I’ve not actually experienced beyond
listening to this album.

## The Avalanches – Since I Left You

![The album cover for Since I Left You](/images/fair-use/since-i-left-you.jpeg)

- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0CvU96jYCiNP4c9u8dWHoI)
- [Apple](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/since-i-left-you/1450114829)

This album is famed for the extreme lengths the creators went to make it out of
samples. I was aware of it long before I listened to it (it was on in various
student pubs while I was doing my undergrad). I first really listened to it one
Summer I was living in Tokyo. It reminds me of the heat and humidity of the
summer there, but also the detachment I felt while I lived there. I moved to
Japan at relatively short notice after a difficult break up, and struggled to
find my footing for a long time after I arrived. This album reminds me of the
joy of summer and feeling at ease with myself and my freedom from my former life
and my culture. It probably marks the point at which I stopped identifying
myself as a nationality or a job, and started thinking of myself as a standard,
awkward mess of a person.

This album reminds me that while we’re all a mishmash of different things, it’s
important to remember the difference between what we are, and what our
environments try to pigeonhole us as. Even more importantly, a mishmash can be a
beautiful and coherent whole.

## Portico Quartet – Memory Streams

![The album cover for Memory Streams](/images/fair-use/memory-streams.jpeg)

- [Bandcamp](https://porticoquartet.bandcamp.com/album/memory-streams)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7rUuKsh6pJLcb44d1NBV81)
- [Apple](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/memory-streams/1583551298)

This is a fairly recent edition, and I find it difficult to categorize. The band
makes instrumental music with heavy use of [the Hang] (a form of steel drum),
saxophones, and synths. I guess it's jazz, but I don't know enough about jazz to
really say. I bought the record as an impulse purchase shortly before the
pandemic lockdowns started. My son was still a baby then, so I was looking for
something to relax to. Due to the timing, it became the sound of the early
pandemic for me. Back then, it felt like the world was just the three of us.

## Boards of Canada – Tomorrow's Harvest

![The album cover for Tomorrow's Harvest](/images/fair-use/tomorrows-harvest.jpeg)

- [Bandcamp](https://boardsofcanada.bandcamp.com/album/tomorrows-harvest)
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/159ORixBSSemxiualv1Woj)
- [Apple](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/tomorrows-harvest/641229267)

This was an impulse buy, pretty much the day it came out in Japan. I used to
spend a lot of time trying to read the staff recommendations in the Tower
Records in Yodobashi Akihabara. Unfortunately that Tower Records has been gone
for a few years now. I had listened to Boards of Canada's earlier work, but
Tomorrow's Harvest blew my mind. The vintage sound and sparseness gives it a
brooding and foreboding feeling. This album is excellent to work to.

I bought this album shortly before moving back to the UK from Japan, so it used
to remind me of that time. I've played it so often since that any nostalgia for
that time has long since gone, but I do still associate it with a change in
mindset that came with changing career from a physics academic to a software
engineer.
