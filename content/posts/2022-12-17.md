Below is a procedural snowman. I'm using a little code to create Christmas
cards again this year, and as before I wanted each to be unique! If you received
a card from me, you may see something like `?seed=1234567890` in the URL bar.
That will be the random seed which generated your snowflake (and it's yours to
keep). To see a random snowflake, remove everything after the question mark and
hit enter. Refresh the page to see a fresh random snowman!

The red colour is a convenience to make it show up in the software I use to
cut card.

Full disclosure; I managed the time badly this year. If you got a card after
Christmas then it's on me (not the mail strikes).
