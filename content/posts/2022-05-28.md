I started a new role recently, and the company is large enough that there are a
number of folk learning or proficient in Japanese as a second language.

I joined a chat session with two other people whose Japanese was much further
along than mine. It was great listening practice (I could mostly follow the
conversation) but I was unable to contribute, which I found disappointing.

I've said it so many times in the past, but I really need to build a study habit
which is substantial enough to improve my proficiency, but light enough that I
can sustain it. Not just flash cards too.

All this is complicated by the little one. Evenings are complicated by his
dinner/bath/bedtime routine, which can be exhausting. Mornings are more open,
but that time needs to be carved out of my existing routine... I could make that
work.

Sometimes it should be book work. I stalled on Genki II because there are holes
in my basic Japanese from stop-start learning over such a long time. I might
pick up Genki I and do one or two morning sessions a week with it.

Other times I think I should read some manga. Two I've been meaning to start
reading which I think may work are {ja:よつばと!} and {ja:しろくまカフェ}. They're
gentle and humorous stories which I think will work well as spring becomes
summer here. I also have some graded readers on the shelf I can start on.

Of course, these are still not speaking, but I hope that if I can improve on
reading and consuming a wider variety of discourse than just set phrases I stand
a better chance of finding the words and phrases I need to contribute in the
Japanese chat sessions.
