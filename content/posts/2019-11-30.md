The graphic below is generated randomly and rendered as an SVG. Occasionally it
glitches, but that's all part of the fun! It was inspired by a graphic seen in
[Charlotte Dann's][charlotte-dann] ffconf 2019 talk. I'll update this post with
a link to the talk when it's up. If I get the time I'll do a write up of the
maths involved.
