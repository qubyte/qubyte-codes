      "Hello #IndieWeb enthusiasts. I’m holding an unofficial Homebrew Website Club at the Lord Nelson Inn near Brighton station tomorrow evening. I’ll be there around 17:30, wrapping up around 20:00. #ffconf folk most welcome!\n\nI’ll post more information when I’ve found a spot, but if you look for a balding dude with a beard and a dubious waxed moustache the odds are good that you’ll find me."
