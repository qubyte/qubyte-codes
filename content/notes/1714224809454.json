It's proof that smart people can design extremely stupid things.\n\nOh, you want an example?\n\nTry `0L until Instant.now`.\n\nIt's a range, right? It's the interval of long integers, containing the numbers $[0, now)$, so it's completely expressible as a pair of longs.\n\nBUT NOT TO SCALA. Scala is like *fuck you there aren't enough regular ints to make this long int range*.\n\nSo, so stupid.",
