The second and third column from the inside are one key higher further from the typist than the other columns, to suit where my middle and ring fingers sit. There are three thumb keys on each side, arranged along a diagonal. The PCB of each side can be seen peaking out on the inside edge, and the controller can be seen on the left hand. A ribbon cable connects the two sides from PCB to PCB. The plates are stainless steel and key caps white.",
