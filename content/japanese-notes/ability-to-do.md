There are two major ways of expressing the ability to do something.

## Verb in the potential form

A verb in the [potential form](potential-form) directly expresses ability:

- <span lang="ja">[食,た](r)べる</span>: to eat
- <span lang="ja">[食,た](r)べられる</span>: to be able to eat

## Using <span lang="ja">[出,で,来,き](r)る</span>

This pattern seems to be used in a more general sense of possibility rather than
for particular events or peeople etc., though I'm not advanced enough to have a
feel for it.

The general pattern is to add
<span lang="ja">[事,こと](r)が[出,で,来,き](r)る</span> to a verb in the dictionary
form.

- <span lang="ja">[食,た](r)べる</span>: to eat
- <span lang="ja">[食,た](r)べる[事,こと](r)が[出,で,来,き](r)る</span>: to be able to eat

For <span lang="ja">する</span> verbs this pattern can be added directly to the
noun:

- <span lang="ja">テニスをする</span>: to play tennis
- <span lang="ja">テニス[事,こと](r)が[出,で,来,き](r)る</span>: to be able to play tennis

This fries my brain a bit when I remember that
<span lang="ja">[出,で,来,き](r)る</span> is already the (irregular) potential
form of <span lang="ja">する</span>.

Remember, when in the negative form the <span lang="ja">が</span> may become a
<span lang="ja">は</span> for emphasis!
