There are two major ways of expressing the ability to do something.

## Verb in the potential form

A verb in the [potential form](potential-form) directly expresses ability:

- {ja:^食,た^べる}: to eat
- {ja:^食,た^べられる}: to be able to eat

## Using {ja:^出,で,来,き^る}

This pattern seems to be used in a more general sense of possibility rather than
for particular events or peeople etc., though I'm not advanced enough to have a
feel for it.

The general pattern is to add
{ja:^事,こと^が^出,で,来,き^る} to a verb in the dictionary
form.

- {ja:^食,た^べる}: to eat
- {ja:^食,た^べる^事,こと^が^出,で,来,き^る}: to be able to eat

For {ja:する} verbs this pattern can be added directly to the
noun:

- {ja:テニスをする}: to play tennis
- {ja:テニス^事,こと^が^出,で,来,き^る}: to be able to play tennis

This fries my brain a bit when I remember that
{ja:^出,で,来,き^る} is already the (irregular) potential
form of {ja:する}.

Remember, when in the negative form the {ja:が} may become a
{ja:は} for emphasis!
