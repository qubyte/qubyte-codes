This page is a hub for the te form, or <span lang="ja">て^形,けい^</span>. It
describes how to conjugate verbs to their te form, and links out to other
articles about its use. See backlinks at the bottom for notes linking to this
one.

### ^一,いち,段,だん^ verbs

Remove the trailing <span lang="ja">る</span> and replace it with a
<span lang="ja">て</span>.

- <span lang="ja">^食,た^べ==る==</span>: to eat
- <span lang="ja">^食,た^べ==て==</span>

### ^五,ご,段,だん^ verbs

The conjugation depends on the final kana in the verb:

When the verb ends in <span lang="ja">う</span>, <span lang="ja">つ</span>, or
<span lang="ja">る</span>, replace the trailing kana with
<span lang="ja">って</span>.

- <span lang="ja">作==る==</span>: to make
- <span lang="ja">作==って==</span>

When the verb ends with <span lang="ja">す</span> replace the trailing kana with
<span lang="ja">して</span>.

- <span lang="ja">^話,はな^==す==</span>: to speak
- <span lang="ja">^話,はな^==して==</span>

When the verb ends with <span lang="ja">く</span> replace the trailing kana with
<span lang="ja">いて</span>.

- <span lang="ja">^履,は^==く==</span>: to put on (lower body)
- <span lang="ja">^履,は^==いて==</span>

Similarly, when a verb ends in a voiced kana, the te form is also voiced:

- <span lang="ja">^急,いそ^==ぐ==</span>: to hurry
- <span lang="ja">^急,いそ^==いで==</span>

Finally, when the verb ends in <span lang="ja">ぬ</span>,
<span lang="ja">ぶ</span>, or <span lang="ja">む</span>, replace the trailing
kana with <span lang="ja">んで</span>.

- <span lang="ja">^住,す^==む==</span>: to inhabit
- <span lang="ja">^住,す^==んで==</span>

### Irregular conjugations

- <span lang="ja">==する==</span> (to do): <span lang="ja">==して==</span>
- <span lang="ja">^来,く^==る==</span> (to come): <span lang="ja">^来,き^==て==</span>
- <span lang="ja">^行,い^==く==</span> (to go): <span lang="ja">^行,い^==って==</span>
- <span lang="ja">〜ま==す==</span>: <span lang="ja">〜ま==して==</span>
