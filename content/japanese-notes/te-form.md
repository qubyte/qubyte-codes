This page is a hub for the te form, or <span lang="ja">て[形,けい](r)</span>. It
describes how to conjugate verbs to their te form, and links out to other
articles about its use. See backlinks at the bottom for notes linking to this
one.

### [一,いち,段,だん](r) verbs

Remove the trailing <span lang="ja">る</span> and replace it with a
<span lang="ja">て</span>.

- <span lang="ja">[食,た](r)べ==る==</span>: to eat
- <span lang="ja">[食,た](r)べ==て==</span>

### [五,ご,段,だん](r) verbs

The conjugation depends on the final kana in the verb:

When the verb ends in <span lang="ja">う</span>, <span lang="ja">つ</span>, or
<span lang="ja">る</span>, replace the trailing kana with
<span lang="ja">って</span>.

- <span lang="ja">作==る==</span>: to make
- <span lang="ja">作==って==</span>

When the verb ends with <span lang="ja">す</span> replace the trailing kana with
<span lang="ja">して</span>.

- <span lang="ja">[話,はな](r)==す==</span>: to speak
- <span lang="ja">[話,はな](r)==して==</span>

When the verb ends with <span lang="ja">く</span> replace the trailing kana with
<span lang="ja">いて</span>.

- <span lang="ja">[履,は](r)==く==</span>: to put on (lower body)
- <span lang="ja">[履,は](r)==いて==</span>

Similarly, when a verb ends in a voiced kana, the te form is also voiced:

- <span lang="ja">[急,いそ](r)==ぐ==</span>: to hurry
- <span lang="ja">[急,いそ](r)==いで==</span>

Finally, when the verb ends in <span lang="ja">ぬ</span>,
<span lang="ja">ぶ</span>, or <span lang="ja">む</span>, replace the trailing
kana with <span lang="ja">んで</span>.

- <span lang="ja">[住,す](r)==む==</span>: to inhabit
- <span lang="ja">[住,す](r)==んで==</span>

### Irregular conjugations

- <span lang="ja">==する==</span>: to do
- <span lang="ja">==して==</span>


- <span lang="ja">[来,く](r)==る==</span>: to come
- <span lang="ja">[来,き](r)==て==</span>


- <span lang="ja">[行,い](r)==く==</span>: to go
- <span lang="ja">[行,い](r)==って==</span>


- <span lang="ja">〜ま==す==</span>
- <span lang="ja">〜ま==して==</span>
