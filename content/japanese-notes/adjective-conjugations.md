This page is a hub for the adjective conjugations. This document is a brief
explainer for the names I use for verb types. See backlinks at the bottom for
notes linking to this one, including links to specific conjugations.

In the linked notes, I use the terminology:

- {ja:^形,けい,容,よう,動,どう,詞,し^}, also known as {ja:な}
  adjectives, and adjectival nouns.
- {ja:^形,けい,容,よう,詞,し^}, also known as {ja:い} adjectives,
  and adjectival verbs.

_Don't look too carefully into the exact translation of the Japanese names into
English, because they're the opposite of what you might expect._

{ja:^形,けい,容,よう,動,どう,詞,し^} are referred to sometimes as adjectival nouns
because they behave a lot like nouns. They conjugate via the copula ({ja:です}
and friends) just like nouns do. The one obvious difference between the two is
the [attributive](attributive-form) uses {ja:な}, whereas nouns use {ja:の}.

{ja:^形,けい,容,よう,詞,し^} are referred to as adjectival verbs for apparently
linguistic reasons. Beyond that there doesn't appear to be much useful
information to the learner to know why, except to expect them to have their own
conjugations (in contrast to {ja:^形,けい,容,よう,動,どう,詞,し^}, which conjugate
via the copula).

- The [attributive form](attributive-form), {ja:^連,れん,体,たい,形,けい^}.
- The [hypothetical form](hypothetical-form), {ja:^仮,か,定,てい,形,けい^}.
