When you want to express a desire for another to perform some action, use the
<span lang="ja">て</span> form of a verb and append
<span lang="ja">ほしい</span> to it.

- [息,むす,子,こ](r)にもっと[野,や,菜,さい](r)を==[食,た](r)べてほしい==です。
- (I) ==want== my son ==to eat== more vegetables.

When mentioning the person the desire is directed toward explicitly, use the
<span lang="ja">に</span> particle as above.

For requests a better choice may be to use <span lang="ja">てくれませんか</span>.
