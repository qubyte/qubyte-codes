When you want to express a desire for another to perform some action, use the
{ja:て} form of a verb and append
{ja:ほしい} to it.

- {ja:^息,むす,子,こ^にもっと^野,や,菜,さい^を==^食,た^べてほしい==です。}
- (I) ==want== my son ==to eat== more vegetables.

When mentioning the person the desire is directed toward explicitly, use the
{ja:に} particle as above.

For requests a better choice may be to use {ja:てくれませんか}.
