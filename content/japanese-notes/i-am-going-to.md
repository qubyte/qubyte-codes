A combination of the [volitional](volitional-form) form of a verb and <span lang="ja">〜と^思,おも^います</span>.

For example:

- <span lang="ja">^今日,きょう^、^公,こう,園,えん^に^行,い^こうと^思,おも^います。</span>
- Literal: I think I shall go to the park today.
- Natural: I (have just decided I) will go to the park today.

The present tense comes with the nuance that the speaker has just made a
decision.

The sentence can be modified to the present progressive to indicate that the
decision is not new.

- <span lang="ja">^今日,きょう^、^公,こう,園,えん^に^行,い^こうと^思,おも^っています。</span>
- Literal: I am thinking that I shall go to the park today.
- Natural: I (decided earlier that I) will go to the park today.
