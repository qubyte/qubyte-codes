A combination of the [volitional](volitional-form) form of a verb and <span lang="ja">〜と[思,おも](r)います</span>.

For example:

- <span lang="ja">[今日,きょう](r)、[公,こう,園,えん](r)に[行,い](r)こうと[思,おも](r)います。</span>
- Literal: I think I shall go to the park today.
- Natural: I (have just decided I) will go to the park today.

The present tense comes with the nuance that the speaker has just made a
decision.

The sentence can be modified to the present progressive to indicate that the
decision is not new.

- <span lang="ja">[今日,きょう](r)、[公,こう,園,えん](r)に[行,い](r)こうと[思,おも](r)っています。</span>
- Literal: I am thinking that I shall go to the park today.
- Natural: I (decided earlier that I) will go to the park today.
