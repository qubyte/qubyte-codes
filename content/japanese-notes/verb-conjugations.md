This page is a hub for the verb conjugations. This document is a brief explainer
for the names I use for verb types. See links at the bottom for notes about
specific conjugations.

In the linked notes, I use the terminology:

- {ja:^五,ご,段,だん^} verbs, also known as
  {ja:う}-verbs, group 1 verbs, and consonant-stem verbs.
- {ja:^一,いち,段,だん^} verbs, also known as
  {ja:る}-verbs, group 2 verbs, and vowel-stem verbs.
- Irregular verbs. These very depending on the conjugation, but the two most
  commonly seen are {ja:する} and
  {ja:^来,く^る}. However, there are others!

Conjugations of verbs documented here:

- The dictionary form (verbs are catalogued in this form).
- The [te form](te-form), {ja:て^形,けい^}.
- The [potential form](potential-form), {ja:^可,か,能,のう,形,けい^}.
- The [volitional form](volitional-form), {ja:^意,い,向,こう,形,けい^}.
