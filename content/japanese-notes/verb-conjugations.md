This page is a hub for the potential form. It describes how to conjugate verbs
to their potential form, and links out to other articles about its use. See
backlinks at the bottom for notes linking to this one.

In the linked notes, I use the terminology:

- <span lang="ja">[五,ご,段,だん](r)</span> verbs, also known as
  <span lang="ja">う</span>-verbs, group 1 verbs, and consonant-stem verbs.
- <span lang="ja">[一,いち,段,だん](r)</span> verbs, also known as
  <span lang="ja">る</span>-verbs, group 2 verbs, and vowel-stem verbs.
- Irregular verbs. These very depending on the conjugation, but the two most
  commonly seen are <span lang="ja">する</span> and
  <span lang="ja">[来,く](r)る</span>. However, there are others!

Conjugations of verbs documented here:

- The dictionary form (verbs are catalogued in this form).
- The [potential form](potential-form).
- The [volitional form](volitional-form).
