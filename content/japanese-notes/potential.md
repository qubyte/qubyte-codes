There are two major ways of expressing the ability to do something.

## Verb in the potential form

A verb in the potential form directly expresses ability:

- <span lang="ja">[食,た](r)べる</span>: to eat
- <span lang="ja">[食,た](r)べられる</span>: to be able to eat

The rules for conjugation are:

### [一,いち,段,だん](r) verbs

Remove the trailing <span lang="ja">る</span> and replace it with
<span lang="ja">られる</span>. In a casual context the <span lang="ja">ら</span>
in the <span lang="ja">られる</span> can be dropped so the appended part becomes
<span lang="ja">れる</span>. For example <span lang="ja">[食,た](r)べれる</span>.

### [五,ご,段,だん](r) verbs

Replace the last kana in the dictionary form of the verb with it's -e sound
companion in the same row of the kana table and append <span lang="ja">る</span>
after. For example, <span lang="ja">[遊,あそ](r)ぶ</span> becomes
<span lang="ja">[遊,あそ](r)べる</span> (the <span lang="ja">ぶ</span> became a
<span lang="ja">べ</span> and a <span lang="ja">る</span>) was appended.

### <span lang="ja">する</span>

<span lang="ja">する</span> is irregular, and becomes
<span lang="ja">[出,で,来,き](r)る</span>.

### <span lang="ja">[来,く](r)る</span>

<span lang="ja">[来,く](r)る</span> is irregular, and becomes
<span lang="ja">[来,こ](r)られる</span>.

### <span lang="ja">ある</span>

<span lang="ja">ある</span> is irregular for this conjugation and becomes both
(note the furigana here):

- <span lang="ja">あり[得,う](r)る</span>
- <span lang="ja">あり[得,え](r)る</span>

Where <span lang="ja">[得,う](r)る</span>/<span lang="ja">[得,え](r)る</span>
means _to gain_, which is interesting!

## Using <span lang="ja">[出,で,来,き](r)る</span>

This pattern seems to be used in a more general sense of possibility rather than
for particular events or peeople etc., though I'm not advanced enough to have a
feel for it.

The general pattern is to add
<span lang="ja">[事,こと](r)が[出,で,来,き](r)る</span> to a verb in the dictionary
form.

- <span lang="ja">[食,た](r)べる</span>: to eat
- <span lang="ja">[食,た](r)べる[事,こと](r)が[出,で,来,き](r)る</span>: to be able to eat

For <span lang="ja">する</span> verbs this pattern can be added directly to the
noun:

- <span lang="ja">テニスをする</span>: to play tennis
- <span lang="ja">テニス[事,こと](r)が[出,で,来,き](r)る</span>: to be able to play tennis

This fries my brain a bit when I remember that
<span lang="ja">[出,で,来,き](r)る</span> is already the (irregular) potential
form of <span lang="ja">する</span>.

Remember, when in the negative form the <span lang="ja">が</span> may become a
<span lang="ja">は</span> for emphasis!
