The order of events in a Japanese sentence can be established a number of ways.
This post covers four ways. The translations of some examples are given two
orders, _literal_ (what I consider the literal translation), and _natural_ (a
translation which feels a bit more natural to me without changing the meaning).

## Verbs in the {ja:て} form.

A list of actions can be given in sequence.

- {ja:^公,こう,園,えん^に^行,い^==って==^遊,あそ^びます。}
- I went to the park and (then) played.

More than one verb may be chained up this way.

## Using {ja:^前,まえ^} (before)

The plain form of a very may be appended with {ja:^前,まえ^に}
to make it come after the action which follows.

- {ja:^寝,ね^る==前に==、^歯,は^を^磨,みが^きます。
  }
- Literal: ==Before== going to bed, I brushed my teeth.
- Natural: I brushed my teeth ==before== going to bed.

## Using {ja:から} (after)

The {ja:て} form may be appended with
{ja:から} to indicate that it comes before the next verb.

- {ja:^歯,は^を^磨,みが^い==てから==、^寝,ね^ます。
  }
- Literal: ==After== brushing my teeth, I went to bed.
- Natural: I went to bed ==after== brushing my teeth.

## Using ^後,あと^ (after)

The {ja:た} form of a verb may be appended with
{ja:^後,あと^で} to indicade that it comes before the
next verb.

- {ja:^歯,は^を^磨,みが^い==た後で==、^寝,ね^ます。
  }
- Literal: ==After== brushing my teeth, I went to bed.
- Natural: I went to bed ==after== brushing my teeth.

## Using {ja:^時,とき^} (before and after)}

{ja:^時,とき^} can be used for both before and after, depending on the tense of
the verb it is appended to.

When the verb is in the plain form, it happens _after_ the next verb. Note that
the tense of the whole sentence is carried by the latter verb.

- {ja:^寝,ね^る==時==、^歯,は^を^磨,みが^きました。}
- Literal: When I went to bed, I brushed my teeth.
- Natural: I brushed my teeth before I went to bed.

When the verb is in the past form, it happens before the next verb. Again, the
tense of the whole sentence is carried by the latter verb.

- {ja:^起,お^き==た時==、シャワーを^浴,あ^びます。}
- Literal: After waking up I take take a shower.
- Natural: I take a shower after waking up.
