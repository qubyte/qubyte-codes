Don't worry, apples are fine but I don't like them as much as this note makes
out.

## {ja:から}

When there is one reason for something, you can use {ja:から}.

- {ja:^雨,あめ^が^止,や^んだ==から==、^出,で^かけました。}
- The rain stopped, ==so== I went out.
- I went outside ==because== the rain stopped, I went outside.

For adjectives, {ja:から} takes the adjective in a plain tense. That is,

### {ja:^形,けい,容,よう,詞,し^}

Use the plain or plain past forms.

- {ja:リンゴがお==いしいから==、よく^食,た^べます。}
- I often eat apples ==because== they're ==tasty==.

### {ja:^形,けい,容,よう,動,どう,詞,し^} and nouns

Use the {ja:だ} or {ja:だった} to couple the adjective or noun to {ja:から} in
the plain or past form respectively.

- {ja:リンゴが==^好,す^きだから==、よく^食,た^べます。}
- I ==like== apples, ==so== I eat them often.
- I eat apples a lot ==because== I ==like== them.

### Verbs

Use verbs in the plain or plain past form. (It would feel more natural to me to
use {ja:^多,おお^かった} here, but the following is for demonstration.).

- {ja:リンゴがたくさん==あったから==、10^個,こ^^買,か^いました。}
- There ==were a lot== of apples, so I bought 10.

## {ja:ので}

{ja:ので} feels more polite than {ja:から}. {ja:ので} works like {ja:から} for
{ja:^形,けい,容,よう,詞,し^} and verbs.

### {ja:^形,けい,容,よう,動,どう,詞,し^} and nouns

Couple the adjective or noun with a {ja:な}.

- {ja:リンゴが^好,す^き==なので==、よく^食,た^べます。}
- I ==like== apples, ==so== I eat them often.
- I eat apples a lot ==because== I ==like== them.

## {ja:し}

When there's more than one reason, {ja:し} can be used to give a complete or
incomplete set of reasons. It couples to adjectives, nouns, and verbs in the
same way as {ja:から}. When only one {ja:し} is used, it may emphasise that more
reasons exist but are being omitted.

- {ja:リンゴが^健,けん,康,こう^に==^良,よ^いし==、==^好,す^きだし==、^私,わたし^はよく^食,た^べます。}
- Apples are ==good for you==, ==and== I ==like== them, ==so== I often eat them.
- I eat a lot of apples ==because== they're ==healthy and== I ==like== them.
