Giving and receiving in Japanese can be confusing to the English speaker,
particularly in how particles are used.

## Giving (self only)

When someone is giving something to the speaker, they must use the verb
{ja:くれます}.

- {ja:^友,とも,達,だち^は^本,ほん^をくれました。}
- My friend gave a book (to me).

Note how I'm not explicitly mentioning myself above in the Japanese version. If
I wanted to explicitly mention myself, I can:

- {ja:^友,とも,達,だち^は==^私,わたし^に==^本,ほん^をくれました。}
- My friend gave a book ==to me==.

The [{ja:に}](./particles-ni) particle technically indicates the direction of
the action, but this is where things get configusing. One way to avoid confusion
is to think in terms of a minimal sentence. In the above case, I didn't need to
mention myself, so the part with {ja:に} wasn't needed.

## Giving (non-self only)

{ja:あげる} behaves just like {ja:くれる}. The only stipulation is in how they're
used.

- {ja:^私,わたし^の^息,むす,子,こ^は^絵,え^をあげました。}
- My son gave a picture.

It's not clear to _whom_, but the sentence is sound. To add the recipient:

- {ja:^私,わたし^の^息,むす,子,こ^は==^妻,つま^に==^絵,え^をあげました。}
- My son gave a picture ==to my wife==.

Once again, the {ja:に} part can be removed for a minimal sentence:



## Receiving (anyone)

As mentioned, the {ja:に} particle is often described in this context as being
the direction of an action, but when contrasting receiving ({ja:もらう}) with
giving things tend to get confusing. The best way I've found to remember how to
use {ja:もらう} is once again to think in terms of a minimal sentence.

- {ja:^私,わたし^はペンをもらいました。}
- I received a pen.

This sentence doesn't say from _whom_. That addition requires the {ja:に}
particle.

- {ja:^私,わたし^は==^友,とも,達,だち^に==ペンをもらいました。}
- I received a pen ==from my friend==.
