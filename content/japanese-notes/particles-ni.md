## A point in time

{ja:に} can be used to indicate an absolute point in time. Such points include
days of the week, months, years, calendar dates, and time of the clock.

- {ja:^毎,まい,日,にち,八,はち,時,じ,半,はん^==に==^起,お^きます。}
- Every day I wake up ==at== 8:30.

## An action toward a person

{ja:に} can be used to indicate when an action is directed toward someone.

- {ja:^私,わたし^は^友,とも,達,だち^==に==ペンをあげました。}
- I gave a pen ==to== my friend.

Note that the verb for receiving ({ja:もらう}) may seem reversed, but the logic
is sound. See the note on [giving and receiving](giving-and-receiving) for more.
