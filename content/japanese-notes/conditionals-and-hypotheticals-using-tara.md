You can compose compose conditional or hypothetical phrases using
{ja:〜たら}. You can compose it using the plain past
conjugation of a word and appending {ja:ら} to it. This is one
of many ways of forming conditionals or hypotheticals!

- noun + {ja:だったら}
- i-adjective without final {ja:い} + {ja:かったら}
- na-adjective + {ja:だったら}
- verb plain past + {ja:ら}

Use {ja:もし} to begin the sentence to make the meaning more of
an _if_, and leave it off to make it more of a _when_, though I'm not sure of
this yet. It usually seems right to omit it.

Noun example:

- {ja:^僕,ぼく^だったら、^新,あたら^しいアパートを^探,さが^す。}
- Literal: If it were me, I'd look for a new apartment.
- Natural: I would look for a new apartment.

Verb example:

- {ja:このキノコを^食,た^べたら、^背,せ^が^高,たか^くなります。}
- Literal: If you eat this mushroom, you will become taller.
- Natural: Eating this mushroom will make you taller.
