You can compose compose conditional or hypothetical phrases using
<span lang="ja">〜たら</span>. You can compose it using the plain past
conjugation of a word and appending <span lang="ja">ら</span> to it. This is one
of many ways of forming conditionals or hypotheticals!

- noun + <span lang="ja">だったら</span>
- i-adjective without final <span lang="ja">い</span> + <span lang="ja">かったら</span>
- na-adjective + <span lang="ja">だったら</span>
- verb plain past + <span lang="ja">ら</span>

Use <span lang="ja">もし</span> to begin the sentence to make the meaning more of
an _if_, and leave it off to make it more of a _when_, though I'm not sure of
this yet. It usually seems right to omit it.

Noun example:

- <span lang="ja">[僕,ぼく](r)だったら、[新,あたら](r)しいアパートを[探,さが](r)す。</span>
- Literal: If it were me, I'd look for a new apartment.
- Natural: I would look for a new apartment.

Verb example:

- <span lang="ja">このキノコを[食,た](r)べたら、[背,せ](r)が[高,たか](r)くなります。</span>
- Literal: If you eat this mushroom, you will become taller.
- Natural: Eating this mushroom will make you taller.
