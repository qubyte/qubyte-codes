This page is a hub for the potential form, or ^可,か,能,のう,形,けい^. It
describes how to conjugate verbs to their potential form, and links out to other
articles about its use. See backlinks at the bottom for notes linking to this
one.

### ^一,いち,段,だん^ verbs

Remove the trailing <span lang="ja">る</span> and replace it with
<span lang="ja">られる</span>. In a casual context the <span lang="ja">ら</span>
in the <span lang="ja">られる</span> can be dropped so the appended part becomes
<span lang="ja">れる</span>.

- <span lang="ja">^食,た^べ==る==</span>: to eat
- <span lang="ja">^食,た^べ==られる==</span>: can eat

### ^五,ご,段,だん^ verbs

Replace the last kana in the dictionary form of the verb with it's -e sound
companion in the same row of the kana table and append <span lang="ja">る</span>
after.

- <span lang="ja">^遊,あそ^==ぶ==</span>: to play
- <span lang="ja">^遊,あそ^==べる==</span>: can play

### <span lang="ja">する</span>

- <span lang="ja">==する==</span>: to do
- <span lang="ja">==^出,で,来,き^==: can do

### <span lang="ja">^来,く^る</span>

- <span lang="ja">^来,く^==る==</span>: to come
- <span lang="ja">^来,こ^==られる==</span>: can come

### <span lang="ja">ある</span>

<span lang="ja">ある</span> is irregular for this conjugation and becomes:

- <span lang="ja">ある</span>: to be (inanimate)
- <span lang="ja">あり^得,え^る</span>: can be (is possible)

Where <span lang="ja">^得,え^る</span> means _to gain_, which is
interesting!
