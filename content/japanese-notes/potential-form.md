This page is a hub for the potential form. It describes how to conjugate verbs
to their potential form, and links out to other articles about its use. See
backlinks at the bottom for notes linking to this one.

### [一,いち,段,だん](r) verbs

Remove the trailing <span lang="ja">る</span> and replace it with
<span lang="ja">られる</span>. In a casual context the <span lang="ja">ら</span>
in the <span lang="ja">られる</span> can be dropped so the appended part becomes
<span lang="ja">れる</span>.

- <span lang="ja">[食,た](r)べ<mark>る</mark></span>: to eat
- <span lang="ja">[食,た](r)べ<mark>られる</mark></span>: can eat

### [五,ご,段,だん](r) verbs

Replace the last kana in the dictionary form of the verb with it's -e sound
companion in the same row of the kana table and append <span lang="ja">る</span>
after.

- <span lang="ja">[遊,あそ](r)<mark>ぶ</mark></span>: to play
- <span lang="ja">[遊,あそ](r)<mark>べる</mark></span>: can play

### <span lang="ja">する</span>

- <span lang="ja"><mark>する</mark></span>: to do
- <span lang="ja"><mark>[出,で,来,き](r)る</mark>: can do

### <span lang="ja">[来,く](r)る</span>

- <span lang="ja">[来,く](r)<mark>る</mark></span>: to come
- <span lang="ja">[来,こ](r)<mark>られる</mark></span>: can come

### <span lang="ja">ある</span>

<span lang="ja">ある</span> is irregular for this conjugation and becomes:

- <span lang="ja">ある</span>: to be (inanimate)
- <span lang="ja">あり[得,え](r)る</span>: can be (is possible)

Where <span lang="ja">[得,え](r)る</span> means _to gain_, which is
interesting!
