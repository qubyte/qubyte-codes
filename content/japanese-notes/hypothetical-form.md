This page is a hub for the hypothetical form {ja:^仮,か,定,てい,形,けい^}. It
describes how to conjugate verbs and adjectives to their hypothetical form.
The hypothetical form is a kind of _stem_ form of both kinds of word, which can
be used to compose a conditional form by appending {ja:ば}.

## {ja:^形,けい,容,よう,動,どう,詞,し^} and nouns

Append {ja:であれば} to the adjective.

- {ja:この^町,まち^は^今日,きょう^^賑,にぎ^やか==であれ====ば==、^田舎,いなか^に^行,い^きましょうか。}
- ==If== this town is ==busy== today, shall we go to the countryside?

The {ja:ある} here is actually the inanimate existence verb.
So a literal meaning could be _if there is busyness_.

## {ja:^形,けい,容,よう,詞,し^}

Drop the {ja:い} (from the
[attributive form](attributive-form)) and append {ja:けれ}.

- {ja:^映,えい,画,が^は^面,おも,白,しろ^==ければ==、また^見,み^ます。}
- ==If== the film is ==interesting== I'll watch it again.

## {ja:^一,いち,段,だん^} verbs

Replace the trailing {ja:る} with {ja:れば}.

- {ja:このキノコを^食,た^べ==れば==、^背,せ^が^高,たか^くなります。}
- ==If== you ==eat== this mushroom, you'll become taller.
