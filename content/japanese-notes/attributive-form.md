## Nouns

Nouns use the [{ja:の}](particles-no) particle to attribute. In English it
roughly corresponds to _of_, with the order reversed.

- B {ja:==の==} A
- A ==of== B

It's common to see this. For example, when you're introducing yourself in a
business setting, you'll use this for to say that you're _of_ the company.

- {ja:ABC==の==スミスです。}
- I'm (John) Smith ==of== ABC (corp).

It's also used for possession.

- {ja:それは^私,わたし^==の==^財,さい,布,ふ^です。}
- That is ==my== wallet.

When the context is clear, the attributive form can be terminated by the
{ja:の}.

- Q: {ja:これは^誰,だれ^の^財,さい,布,ふ^ですか。}
- Q: Who's wallet is this?
- A: {ja:^私,わたし^のです。}
- A: It's mine.

## Adjectives
### {ja:^形,けい,容,よう,動,どう,詞,し^}

{ja:^形,けい,容,よう,動,どう,詞,し^} use a particle to attribute, just like nouns
do. Unlike nouns they use {ja:な} rather than {ja:の}.

- {ja:^静,しず^か==な==^村,むら^です。}
- (It is) a quiet village.

### {ja:^形,けい,容,よう,詞,し^}

In multilingual dictionaries {ja:^形,けい,容,よう,詞,し^} are usually listed in
their attributive form, so there's not much more to know!

- {ja:^騒,そう,々,ぞう^しい^町,まち^です。}
- (It's a) noisy city.
