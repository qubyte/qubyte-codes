<span lang="ja">もう</span> can be used to express when something is already the
case, or will not be the case again.

Consider this famous line from Fist of the North Star:

- <span lang="ja">お^前,まえ^は==もう==^死,し^んでいる。</span>
- You are ==already== dead.

When used with negative form verbs, <span lang="ja">もう</span> means _anymore_. Example:

- <span lang="ja">==もう==^行,い^かない</span>
- I won't go ==anymore==.

<span lang="ja">もう</span> is often contrasted with <span lang="ja">まだ</span>.
See the [notes on <span lang="ja">まだ</span>](not-yet-or-still-with-mada).
