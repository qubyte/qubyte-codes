{ja:もう} can be used to express when something is already the
case, or will not be the case again.

Consider this famous line from Fist of the North Star:

- {ja:お^前,まえ^は==もう==^死,し^んでいる。}
- You are ==already== dead.

When used with negative form verbs, {ja:もう} means _anymore_. Example:

- {ja:==もう==^行,い^かない}
- I won't go ==anymore==.

{ja:もう} is often contrasted with {ja:まだ}.
See the [notes on {ja:まだ}](not-yet-or-still-with-mada).
