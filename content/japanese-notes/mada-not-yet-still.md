<span lang="ja">まだ</span> can be used to express when something is not yet the case, or is still the case.

For affirmative forms of verbs <span lang="ja">まだ</span> means _still_.
Example:

- <span lang="ja">==まだ==^日,に,本,ほん,語,ご^を^勉,べん,強,きょう^してるの？</span>
- Are you ==still== studying Japanese?

For negative forms of verbs <span lang="ja">まだ</span> means _not yet_. That
said, it still means _still_ when you think about it!

- <span lang="ja">まだエディンバラに^行,い^きません。</span>
- I haven't been to Edinburgh yet.
- I still haven't been to Edinburgh.

<span lang="ja">まだ</span> is often contrasted with <span lang="ja">もう</span>.
See the [notes on <span lang="ja">もう</span>](already-or-anymore-with-mou).
