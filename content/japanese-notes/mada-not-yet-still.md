{ja:まだ} can be used to express when something is not yet the case, or is still the case.

For affirmative forms of verbs {ja:まだ} means _still_.
Example:

- {ja:==まだ==^日,に,本,ほん,語,ご^を^勉,べん,強,きょう^してるの？}
- Are you ==still== studying Japanese?

For negative forms of verbs {ja:まだ} means _not yet_. That
said, it still means _still_ when you think about it!

- {ja:まだエディンバラに^行,い^きません。}
- I haven't been to Edinburgh yet.
- I still haven't been to Edinburgh.

{ja:まだ} is often contrasted with {ja:もう}.
See the [notes on {ja:もう}](already-or-anymore-with-mou).
