Using {ja:も}, {ja:だけ}, and
{ja:しか} can add nuance to amounts of things.

## Many using {ja:も}

By inserting {ja:も} after a number or counter, it adds the
nuance that the speaker feels that the quantity is large.

Example:

- Mark has _ten_ cars.
- {ja:マークさんは^車,くるま^を十台==も==^持,も^っています。}

## Not many using {ja:だけ}

Similar to {ja:も}, you can use {ja:だけ}
after a number or counter to add nuance. In this case the nuance added is that
the speaker feels the quantity is low.

Example:

- Mark _only_ has one pen.
- {ja:マークさんはペンを一つ==だけ==^持,も^っています。}

## Not many using {ja:しか}

Similar to {ja:だけ}, you can use {ja:しか}
after a number or counter to add the nuance that the speaker feels the quantity
is low. Unlike {ja:だけ}, {ja:しか} requires
that the verb used is in its negative form.

Example:

- Mark _only_ has one pen.
- {ja:マークさんはペンを一つ==しか==^持,も^って==いません==。}

I'd entirely forgotten how to use {ja:しか} since early on I'd
learnt about {ja:だけ}, which doesn't negate the verb (making
it easier for me to remember).
