Using <span lang="ja">も</span>, <span lang="ja">だけ</span>, and
<span lang="ja">しか</span> can add nuance to amounts of things.

## Many using <span lang="ja">も</span>

By inserting <span lang="ja">も</span> after a number or counter, it adds the
nuance that the speaker feels that the quantity is large.

Example:

- Mark has _ten_ cars.
- <span lang="ja">マークさんは車を十台<mark>も</mark>もっています。</span>

## Not many using <span lang="ja">だけ</span>

Similar to <span lang="ja">も</span>, you can use <span lang="ja">だけ</span>
after a number or counter to add nuance. In this case the nuance added is that
the speaker feels the quantity is low.

Example:

- Mark _only_ has one pen.
- <span lang="ja">マークさんはペンを一つ<mark>だけ</mark>持っています。</span>

## Not many using <span lang="ja">しか</span>

Similar to <span lang="ja">だけ</span>, you can use <span lang="ja">しか</span>
after a number or counter to add the nuance that the speaker feels the quantity
is low. Unlike <span lang="ja">だけ</span>, <span lang="ja">しか</span> requires
that the verb used is in its negative form.

Example:

- Mark _only_ has one pen.
- <span lang="ja">マークさんはペンを一つ<mark>しか</mark>持って<mark>いません</mark>。</span>

I'd entirely forgotten how to use <span lang="ja">しか</span> since early on I'd
learnt about <span lang="ja">だけ</span>, which doesn't negate the very (making
it easier for me to remember).
