        Welcome to <a href="https://qubyte.codes">qubyte.codes</a>! The personal
        site of Mark Stanley Everitt.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a programmer specialising in JavaScript, living and working in
        Brighton, UK. This blog is a place for me to write about stuff I find
        interesting or useful. Probably JavaScript for the most part, but
        certainly not limited to it. By day I spend most of my programming time
        writing Node.js applications, with a little browser stuff when I can.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also interested in the social side and ethics of software
        development. I'm a regular mentor at
        <a href="https://codebar.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codebar</a>
        in Brighton.
      </p>
      <p>
        I lived and worked in Tokyo for a number of years, initially as an
        academic (I hold a PhD in quantum optics and quantum information), and
        later as a programmer. I speak a little Japanese and continue to study
        the language.
