In [a recent post][about-this-blog-3] I wrote that I had integrated
webmentions, and some of that has since changed. Time for an update.

I was using Netlify form handling as an easy way to handle webmentions, but
unfortunately they inject an additional input into forms. This input is
required by Netlify to name the form, and `POST` requests which lack it get a
404 response. This in turn meant that the manual mention form at the bottom of
each post worked, but regular webmentions (which only have `source` and `target`
parameters) did not.

I replaced this functionality by pointing the form and webmention link to
[webmention.io][webmention.io], which was simple since I already have
[IndieAuth][indieauth] working with this blog. I may make a custom receiver for
webmentions later, but this is an excellent stopgap.

On to more exciting stuff... I've been enjoying [Mastodon][mastodon] lately. An
[issue was recently opened][webmentions-issue] about having Mastodon dispatch
webmentions for links in status updates. Unfortunately (but I think for good
reasons), it didn't work out and the issue is now closed. I'm happy for my own
status updates to dispatch webmentions though, so I
[put together a glitch][webmentions-glitch] to do this for me! Take a look, and
remix if you like the idea.
